Hertha BSC plays in the Bundesliga, the top-tier of German football, after finishing first in the 2. Bundesliga in 2013.\r\n\r\nHertha BSC was founded in 1892, and was a founding member of the German Football Association in Leipzig in 1900. The team won the German championship in 1930 and 1931. Since 1963, Hertha's stadium has been the Olympiastadion. The club is known as Die Alte Dame in German, which translates to \"The Old Lady\". In 2002, the sports activities of the professional, amateur, and under-19 teams were separated into Hertha BSC GmbH & Co. KGaA.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly years\r\nThe club was formed in 1892 as BFC Hertha 92, taking its name from a steamship with a blue and white smokestack; one of the four young men who founded the club had taken a day trip on this ship with his father. The name Hertha is a variation on Nerthus referring to fertility goddess from Germanic mythology.\r\n\r\nHertha performed consistently well on the field, including a win in the first Berlin championship final in 1905. In May 1910, Hertha won a friendly match against Southend United, which was considered significant at the time, as England was where the game originated and English clubs dominated the sport. However, their on-field success was not matched financially and in 1920 the staunchly working-class Hertha merged with the well-heeled club Berliner Sport-Club to form Hertha Berliner Sport-Club. The new team continued to enjoy considerable success in the Oberliga Berlin-Brandenburg, while also enduring a substantial measure of frustration. The team played its way to the German championship final in six consecutive seasons from 1926 to 1931, but was only able to win the title in 1930 and 1931 with BSC leaving to become an independent club again after the combined side's first championship. Notwithstanding, Hertha emerged as the Germany's second most successful team during the inter-war years.\r\n\r\nPlay under the Third Reich\r\nGerman football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into 16 top-flight divisions, which saw Hertha playing in the Gauliga Berlin-Brandenburg. The club continued to enjoy success within their division, regularly finishing in the upper half of the table and capturing the divisional title in 1935, 1937 and 1944. It faded from prominence, however, unable to advance out of the early rounds of the national championship rounds. Politically, the club was overhauled under Hitler, with Hans Pfeifer, a Nazi party member, being installed as president.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/qpsryu1473453350.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133658-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/rssuvv1420480604.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ywxxwx1424315376.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/tqstsy1454144518.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wtsvxx1454144429.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/twspqs1454144153.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/wptpuu1454144126.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/user\/herthatv","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133657","idSoccerXML":"64","idAPIfootball":"167","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Hoffenheim","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"TSG 1899 Hoffenheim","intFormedYear":"1899","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Bundesliga","idLeague":"4331","strLeague2":"DFB-Pokal","idLeague2":"4485","strLeague3":"","idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":"","idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Rhein-Neckar-Arena","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/qqxuyt1423712601.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Rhein-Neckar-Arena (also known as Wirsol Rhein-Neckar-Arena  for sponsoring purposes) is a multi-purpose stadium in Sinsheim, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Germany.

A fifth division side in 2000, the club made a remarkable advance to the German football league system top tier Bundesliga in 2008 with the financial backing of alumnus and software mogul Dietmar Hopp.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nThe modern-day club was formed in 1945, when gymnastics club Turnverein Hoffenheim (founded 1 July 1899) and football club Fu\u00dfballverein Hoffenheim (founded 1921) merged. At the beginning of the 1990s, the club was an obscure local amateur side playing in the eighth division Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg A-Liga. They steadily improved and by 1996 were competing in the Verbandsliga Nordbaden (V).\r\n\r\nAround 2000, alumnus Dietmar Hopp returned to the club of his youth as a financial backer. Hopp was the co-founder of software firm SAP and he put some of his money into the club. His contributions generated almost immediate results: in 2000 Hoffenheim finished first in the Verbandsliga and was promoted to the fourth-division Oberliga Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. Another first-place finish moved the club up to the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (III) for the 2001\u201302 season. They finished 13th in their first season in the Regionalliga, but improved significantly the next year, earning a fifth-place result.\r\n\r\nHoffenheim earned fifth and seventh-place finishes in the next two seasons, before improving to fourth in 2005\u201306 to earn their best result to date. The club made its first DFB-Pokal appearance in the 2003\u201304 competition and performed well, advancing to the quarter-finals by eliminating 2. Bundesliga sides Eintracht Trier and Karlsruher SC and Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen before being put out themselves by another 2. Bundesliga side, VfB L\u00fcbeck.\r\n\r\nNegotiations to merge TSG Hoffenheim, Astoria Walldorf, and SV Sandhausen to create FC Heidelberg 06 in 2005 were abandoned due to the resistance of the latter two clubs, and the failure to agree on whether the new side's stadium should be located in Heidelberg or Eppelheim. Team owner Hopp clearly preferred Heidelberg, but could not overcome the resistance of local firm Wild, which had already reserved the site of the planned stadium for its new production facilities.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/qusuxu1473453358.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133657-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/bhwri31543832431.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/sxsvvv1424536655.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/9xpyfc1543771558.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/ir034c1543771566.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/8cd0v91543771574.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/ckcy8c1543773284.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133666","idSoccerXML":"74","idAPIfootball":"168","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Leverkusen","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Bayer 04 Leverkusen, Bayer Leverkusen","intFormedYear":"1904","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Bundesliga","idLeague":"4331","strLeague2":"DFB-Pokal","idLeague2":"4485","strLeague3":"UEFA Europa League","idLeague3":"4481","strLeague4":"","idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"BayArena","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/qsytyu1423712470.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"The BayArena is a football stadium in Leverkusen, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, which has been the home ground of Bundesliga club Bayer Leverkusen since 1958. It is not a UEFA 5-star stadium, however it is in the process of becoming one.\r\n\r\nThe stadium was originally known as Ulrich-Haberland-Stadion (pronounced  ( listen); English: Ulrich Haberland Stadium), named after a former chairman of Bayer AG, the club's founders. Its original capacity was 20,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1986, a rebuilding project began to convert it into a modern facility; the project continued intermittently over the following decade. The project was completed in 1997, making the stadium an ultramodern all-seater with a capacity of 22,500. The stadium was renamed BayArena in 1998.\r\n\r\nIn 1999, a hotel attached to the stadium was completed, with some rooms having a view of the pitch. The stadium complex also includes a high-class restaurant, which also overlooks the pitch, and conference facilities.\r\n\r\nThe city of Leverkusen originally bid to become a venue for the 2006 World Cup, with an expanded BayArena as the site. However, the city, Bayer Leverkusen, and the German organizing committee soon agreed that expanding BayArena to the FIFA-mandated minimum 40,000 capacity for World Cup matches would not be practical, and the city withdrew its bid.

Fu\u00dfball- und Sportverein Mainz 05 e. V., usually shortened to 1. FSV Mainz 05, Mainz 05  or simply Mainz, is a German association football club, founded in 1905 and based in Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate. 1. FSV Mainz 05 have played in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system, for eight consecutive years, starting with the 2009\u201310 season. The club's main local rivals are Eintracht Frankfurt and 1. FC Kaiserslautern. In addition to the football division, 1. FSV Mainz 05 have handball and table tennis departments.\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nEarly years\r\nA failed attempt to start a football club in the city in 1903 was followed up two years later by the successful creation of 1. Mainzer Fussballclub Hassia 1905. After a number of years of play in the S\u00fcddeutschen Fu\u00dfballverband (South German Football League), the club merged with FC Hermannia 07 \u2013 the former football side of Mainzer TV 1817 \u2013 to form 1. Mainzer Fussballverein Hassia 05, which dropped \"Hassia\" from its name in August 1912. Another merger after World War I, in 1919, with Sportverein 1908 Mainz, resulted in the formation of 1. Mainzer Fu\u00dfball- und Sportverein 05. Die Nullf\u00fcnfer were a solid club that earned several regional league championships in the period between the wars and qualified for the opening round of the national championships in 1921, after winning the Kreisliga Hessen.\r\n\r\nPlay during the Nazi era\r\nIn the late 1920s and early 1930s, the club earned decent results in the Bezirksliga Main-Hessen \u2013 Gruppe Hessen, including first-place finishes in 1932 and 1933. This merited the team a place in the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest, 1 of 16 new first division leagues formed in the re-organization of German football under the Third Reich. Unfortunately, the club only managed a single season at that level before being relegated, due to the high intensity play that they were unable to keep up with. Karl Scherm scored in 23 out of 44 matches with Mainz during his last season. In 1938, Mainz was forced into a merger with Reichsbahn SV Mainz and played as Reichsbahn SV Mainz 05 until the end of World War II.\r\n\r\nLong march to the Bundesliga\r\n\r\nHistorical chart of 1. FSV Mainz league performance after WWII\r\nAfter World War II, the club again joined the upper ranks of league play in Germany's Oberliga S\u00fcdwest, but were never better than a mid-table side. It played in the top flight until the founding of the new professional league, the Bundesliga, in 1963 and would go on to play as a second division side for most of the next four decades. They withdrew for a time \u2013 from the late 1970s into the late 1980s \u2013 to the Amateur Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (III), as the result of a series of financial problems. Mainz earned honours as the German amateur champions in 1982.\r\n\r\nThe club returned to professional play with promotion to the 2. Bundesliga for a single season in 1988\u201389 with Bodo Hertlein as president, before finally returning for an extended run in 1990\u201391. Initially, they were perennial relegation candidates, struggling hard each season to avoid being sent down. However, under unorthodox trainer Wolfgang Frank, Mainz became one of the first clubs in German soccer to adopt a flat four zone defence, as opposed to the then-popular man-to-man defense using a libero.\r\n\r\nMainz failed in three attempts to make it to the top flight in 1996\u201397, 2001\u201302, and 2002\u201303, with close fourth-place finishes just out of the promotion zone. The last failed attempt stung as they were denied promotion in the 93rd minute of the last match of the season. One year earlier, Mainz became the best non-promoted team of all-time in the 2. Bundesliga with 64 points accumulated. However, the club's persistence paid dividends after promotion to the Bundesliga in 2003\u201304 under head coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp. The club played three seasons in the top flight but were relegated at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. Mainz then secured promotion back to the top flight just two years later, after the 2008\u201309 season.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormer logo\r\nMainz also earned a spot in the 2005\u201306 UEFA Cup in their debut Bundesliga season as Germany's nominee in the Fair Play draw which acknowledges positive play, respect for one's opponent, respect for the referee, the behaviour of the crowd and of team officials, as well as cautions and dismissals. Due to the Bruchweg stadium's limited capacity, the home matches in UEFA Cup were played in Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena. After defeating Armenian club Mika and Icelandic club Keflav\u00edk in the qualifying rounds, Mainz lost to eventual champions Sevilla 2\u20130 on aggregate in the first round.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Mainz equalled the Bundesliga starting record by winning their first seven matches that season. They ended the season with their best finish to date in fifth place, good enough to secure them their second entry to the UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated in the third qualifying round by Romanian club Gaz Metan Media\u0219.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/fhm9v51552134916.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/yvyptv1474197215.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/dj769c1543926175.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/uyrxwt1424537020.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/c72e0j1542879905.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/cmrwjx1542879944.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/spwyqv1424537590.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/x4p7w01543773766.jpg","strYoutube":"www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCMT1hwsDgOEMhS2dIfD3e6A","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"134779","idSoccerXML":"72","idAPIfootball":"163","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"M\u00f6nchengladbach","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach","intFormedYear":"1900","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Bundesliga","idLeague":"4331","strLeague2":"DFB-Pokal","idLeague2":"4485","strLeague3":"","idLeague3":null,"strLeague4":"","idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":"","idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":"","idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Borussia-Park","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/rtyxxp1423713572.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Borussia-Park (official name \"Stadion im Borussia-Park\") in M\u00f6nchengladbach, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany is the home stadium of German Bundesliga club Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach.

In 1997, the city of Leipzig decided to build a new stadium within the old stadium, a modern state of the art stadium only for football. The new stadium was built from December 2000 till March 2004. A similar endeavor of constructing a new stadium within the confines of an historic stadium's exterior was completed in Chicago's Soldier Field, which similarly build a modern stadium while preserving the exterior of the original structure.\r\n\r\nThe Zentralstadion was the only stadium in the former East Germany to host games in the 2006 FIFA World Cup. It hosted four group matches and a round of 16 game in the tournament. A year earlier, it was also one of the venues for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup and hosted three matches of the tournament, including the third-place match. From 2005 to 2007, the Zentralstadion was host of the German League Cup final.\r\n\r\nFC Sachsen Leipzig used the stadium as a home ground from time to time between 2004 and 2007, however they moved back to their traditional home, the Alfred-Kunze-Sportpark at the start of the 2008\u201309 season.\r\n\r\nIn July 2009, energy drink manufacturer Red Bull took over the license of SSV Markranst\u00e4dt and renamed the team RasenBallsport Leipzig, in short RB Leipzig. From the outset, the new team outlined their wish to move into the tenant-less Zentralstadion and rename it the \"Red Bull Arena\". The naming rights were granted on 25 March 2010 and the stadium will be named so for a minimum period of 10 years as of 1 July 2010. The cost for renting the stadium will rise in accordance with the level of football RasenBallsport Leipzig are at. The team has pledged to upgrade the seating, install video advertising boards and make changes to the boxes and the VIP area.\r\n\r\nIn the 2010\u201311 season, Hallescher FC played between three and five games at the Zentralstadion due to their own Kurt-Wabbel Stadion being renovated.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, the stadium was ranked 17th in the country based on attendance, safety, and number of events.\r\n\r\nFacilities\r\n\r\nRed Bull Arena with Festwiese\r\n\r\nLeipzig city centre with Red Bull Arena to the right\r\nThere are bridges built over the old stadium to connect with the new stadium.

V., commonly known as Werder Bremen, is a German sports club located in Bremen in the northwest German federal state Free Hanseatic City of Bremen. The club was founded in 1899 and has grown to 40,400 members. It is best known for its association football team.\r\n\r\nBremen's football club has been a mainstay in the Bundesliga, the top league of the German football league system. Bremen have won the Bundesliga championship four times and the DFB-Pokal six times. Their latest championship in each came in 2004, when they won a double. Bremen have also had European success, winning the 1992 European Cup Winners' Cup. Bremen also reached the final match of the last edition of the UEFA Cup in 2009 (it was rebranded the UEFA Europa League the following season), During the early 2000s, Bremen was one of the most successful teams in the Bundesliga, but the club has not played in a European competition since the 2010\u20132011 campaign.\r\n\r\nSince 1924, Werder Bremen's stadium is the Weserstadion. Werder Bremen's manager is Viktor Skrypnyk. Werder Bremen has a rivalry with Hamburger SV, another Bundesliga club in northern Germany, known as the Nordderby (English: North derby).\r\n\r\nThe club was founded on 4 February 1899 as Fu\u00dfballverein Werder by a group of 16 vocational high school students who had won a prize of sports equipment. The students took the club's name from the seldom-used regional German word for \u201criver peninsula\", which described the riverside field on which they played their first football games.\r\n\r\nThe predecessor to Bremen, known as SV Werder, played its first ever match on 10 September 1899 against ASC 1898 Bremen coming away with a 1\u20130 victory. In 1900 FV Bremen was represented at the founding of the German Football Association (DFB) at Leipzig. The club then enjoyed some early success, fielding competitive sides and winning a number of local championships. FV took part in the qualification play for the national championships in playoffs held by the Norddeutscher Fussball Verband (NFV), one of the seven major regional leagues after the turn of the century, but were unable to advance. They became the first club to charge spectators a fee to attend their games and to fence in their playing field.\r\n\r\nIn April 1914, the club became a department of Allgemeiner Bremer Turnverein 1860 and was briefly known as Sportabteilung Werder des ABTV. However, the relationship was short-lived and the club went its own way again less than two months later.\r\n\r\nSteady growth after World War I led the club to adopt other sports and, on 19 January 1920, change their name to the current Sportverein Werder Bremen. Football remained their primary interest, so much so that in 1922, they became the first German club to hire a professional coach. The team made regular appearances in year-end NFV qualification round play through the 1920s and on into the early 1930s, but did not enjoy any success.\r\n\r\nGerman football was re-organized under the Third Reich in 1933 into 16 first division leagues known as Gauligen and Werder became part of the Gauliga Niedersachsen. The club scored its first real successes, capturing division titles in 1934, 1936, and 1937, and took part for the first time in national level playoff competition. The shape of the Gauligen changed through the course of World War II and in 1939, the Gauliga Niedersachsen was split into two divisions. SV played in the Gauliga Niedersachsen\/Nord where they captured a fourth title in 1942. As the war overtook the country, the Gauligen became progressively more local in character. The Gauliga Niedersachsen\/Nord became the Gauliga Weser-Ems and then the Gauliga Weser-Ems\/Bremen over the next two years. Werder's 1944\u201345 season was cut short after just two matches.\r\n\r\nLike other organizations throughout Germany, the club was disbanded on the order of the occupying Allied authorities after the war. They re-constituted themselves 10 November 1945 as Turn- und Sportverein Werder 1945 Bremen, which was changed to Sport-Club Gr\u00fcn-Wei\u00df 99 Bremen on 4 February 1946. The team took up play in the Stadtliga Bremen, and after capturing a title there, participated in the northern German championship round, advancing to the quarterfinals. They were able to reclaim the name SV Werder on 25 March 1946 before taking part in the playoffs.\r\n\r\nAt the time, professionals were not permitted to play in the German game, so it was normal for football players to take on other jobs, often with the club's local patron. In the case of Werder, a number of the players worked at the nearby Brinkmann tobacco factory, and so the side took on the nickname Texas 11 after one of the company's popular cigarette brands.\r\n\r\nBetween the end of the war and the formation of the Bundesliga in 1963 the club continued to do well, being recognized as one of the top two teams in northern Germany, along with Hamburger SV. In 1961, they managed their first DFB-Pokal win. Their performance was good enough to earn them a place as a charter member of the Bundesliga, and in the league's second season, Werder took the championship. They earned a second-place finish in the 1967\u201368, but then languished in the bottom half of the table for a dozen years. An attempt to improve their lot by signing high-priced talent earned the side the new, derisive nickname of the Millionaires and turned out to be an expensive failure. The club dropped out of the Bundesliga for the first and only time, being relegated to the 2nd Bundesliga-Nord for the 1980\u201381 season after a 17th place finish.","strDescriptionDE":null,"strDescriptionFR":null,"strDescriptionCN":null,"strDescriptionIT":null,"strDescriptionJP":null,"strDescriptionRU":null,"strDescriptionES":null,"strDescriptionPT":null,"strDescriptionSE":null,"strDescriptionNL":null,"strDescriptionHU":null,"strDescriptionNO":null,"strDescriptionIL":null,"strDescriptionPL":null,"strGender":"Male","strCountry":"Germany","strTeamBadge":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/badge\/uurwqy1473453408.png","strTeamJersey":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/jersey\/2019-133662-Jersey.png","strTeamLogo":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/logo\/eyfwi71544617894.png","strTeamFanart1":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/wvysqt1424316088.jpg","strTeamFanart2":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/vqttst1424316106.jpg","strTeamFanart3":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/5rr36p1543487307.jpg","strTeamFanart4":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/fanart\/xq9y791543487334.jpg","strTeamBanner":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/banner\/7sjs071543772810.jpg","strYoutube":"","strLocked":"unlocked"},{"idTeam":"133655","idSoccerXML":"62","idAPIfootball":"161","intLoved":null,"strTeam":"Wolfsburg","strTeamShort":null,"strAlternate":"VfL Wolfsburg","intFormedYear":"1945","strSport":"Soccer","strLeague":"German Bundesliga","idLeague":"4331","strLeague2":"DFB-Pokal","idLeague2":"4485","strLeague3":"UEFA Europa League","idLeague3":"4481","strLeague4":"","idLeague4":null,"strLeague5":"","idLeague5":null,"strLeague6":null,"idLeague6":null,"strLeague7":null,"idLeague7":null,"strDivision":null,"strManager":"","strStadium":"Volkswagen Arena","strKeywords":"","strRSS":"","strStadiumThumb":"https:\/\/www.thesportsdb.com\/images\/media\/team\/stadium\/xtpxyp1423711901.jpg","strStadiumDescription":"Volkswagen Arena is a multi-purpose stadium in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany and serves as the home stadium of the 2008\u201309 Bundesliga champions VfL Wolfsburg.
